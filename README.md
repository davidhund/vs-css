# VS-CSS
## Basic(!), reusable CSS snippets and components

This is _not_ a 'CSS Framework' or anything of that order; it is simply a collection of reusable CSS components. I try to keep the CSS as up-to-date as possible, meaning that I will choose i.e. 'advanced' CSS3 selectors and properties where appropriate but will also use _hacks_ and workarounds.

The CSS is heavily documented and *not meant to be copied* as-is. Feel free to use what seems useful but please clean up the CSS. Use Internet Explorer hacks in _conditional comments_ if it seems appropriate. I've chosen to have all CSS in one file for easier maintenance, because it saves a HTTP request and because the context of a certain rule is more clear. If you already use Conditional Comments in your project, please add the rules to those files.

I'm pretty sure there's heaps of room for improvement: feedback is more than welcome!
